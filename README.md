## Customization

### Adding New Teams
Update the `team_prefixes` dictionary in both `scraper.py` and `data_processor.py`:

```python
self.team_prefixes = {
    'BB': 'B0aty Brawlers',
    'DN': 'Dino Nuggets',
    # Add new teams here
}
```

### Modifying Update Frequency
Change the interval in `app.py`:

```python
scheduler.add_job(func=update_data, trigger="interval", minutes=15)  # Change minutes value
```

### Custom Styling
Modify the CSS variables in `templates/base.html`:

```css
:root {
    --rs-gold: #FFD700;
    --rs-dark: #2C1810;
    /* Add custom colors */
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data not loading**: Check if the hiscores website is accessible
2. **Slow performance**: Reduce update frequency or optimize scraping
3. **Missing teams**: Verify team prefixes match player names
4. **Charts not displaying**: Ensure Plotly.js is loaded correctly

### Debugging

Enable debug mode in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Check console logs for scraping errors and data processing issues.
